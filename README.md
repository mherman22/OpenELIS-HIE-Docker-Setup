# OpenELIS-OpenCR-HIE-Setup
This integration aims to connect OpenELIS, a laboratory information system, with a FHIR-Based Open Client Registry which will allow users to search for patients within their local OpenELIS system, If the patient isn't found locally, search the client registry then Import patient information from the client registry to OpenELIS. 

In simpler terms, this lets users find patients within their local system and if not found, search for them in a central database and bring their information back into the local system.

## How-Tos

### Pre-Requesites 
- Git: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git
- Git Large File Storage: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage
- Docker: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/

### Startup

- ```
    git clone https://github.com/mherman22/OpenELIS-OpenCR-HIE-Setup
    ```
- ```
    git lfs fetch
    ```
-  ```
    git lfs checkout
    ```
- ```
    git lfs pull
    ```
In the file found at "./configs/opencr/config.json" change the
installed flag under app to false to load configs for Opencr  
```
"app": {
    "port": 3000,
    "installed": false
}
```


### Resetting and Clearing OpenCR 
- ```
    docker stop opencr opencr-fhir es
  ```
- ```
    docker system prune --volumes
  ```
## Local setup

- ```
  cd esplugin/string-similarity
  ```
- ```
  unzip string-similarity-scoring-0.0.6-es7.9.1.zip
  ```

## Spin up the services

- ```
    docker compose -f openelis-opencr-hie-docker-compose.yml up -d
    ```
### You should be able to acces the OpenELIS ,OpenHIM , OpenCR and Hapi-Fhir instances  at the following urls
| Instance  |     URL       | credentials (user : password)|
|---------- |:-------------:|------:                       |
| OpenHIM   | http://localhost:9000  |  root@openhim.org : openhim |
| OpenCR    | http://localhost:3000/crux  |  root@intrahealth.org  : intrahealth|
| OpenELIS | https://localhost/login |   Â admin : adminADMIN!| 

### Restart the Streaming pipeline to work Properly
After spinning up the Sigdep3 , restart the Streaming pipeline to Stream all Changes to the SHR (Fixed by adding depends-on meta in compose file)
- ```
    docker restart streaming-pipeline
    ```

### Configure OpenHIM URL for client registry module of OpenMRS
Set the CLIENTREGISTRY_SERVERURL, CLIENTREGISTRY_USERNAME, CLIENTREGISTRY_PASSWORD, CLIENTREGISTRY_IDENTIFIERROOT in the .env file
Note that the Openhim should be up before starting the OpenMRS service. Currently this is ensured on local setup with the depends-on meta in the compose file


### Possible challenges
Ensure the .db folder at the root has permissions to allow docker to write files

###
Running on gitpod
Change the env var of es to have only 
`      - xpack.security.enabled=false
        - discovery.type=single-node
`
and change the ulimit as 
`
ulimits:
      nofile:
        soft: 65536
        hard: 65536
`    
Follow the blog here: https://www.gitpod.io/blog/local-app to enable localhost on your machine

Incase spark image is failing. Consider upgrading the docker engine.
See [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#upgrade-docker-engine)

### Deploying with ansible to remote server
Install ansible on the host machine following steps here https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/installation_distros.html    
Ensure the public key is already added to the remote server    
Update the path to your private key on the variable ansible_ssh_private_key_file    
Update the inventory.ini file with the host addresses    
Run the command below in the distribution    
Enter password of the private key when prompted    

- ```sh
    cd deployment
    ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini deployment.yml
    ```

Run the following command in the test folder using newman to preload the client registry

- ```
    npm install -g newman
    ```
- ```
    newman run postman_collection.json -e postman_environment.json --iteration-data pims_rule_test_dataset.csv --insecure
   ```
